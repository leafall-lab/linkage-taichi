# linkage-taichi

An efficient, freely editable linkage system powered by [taichi](https://docs.taichi-lang.cn/).

This project is build in Taichi Hackathon 2022, see our Chinese design doc [here](/design-ch.md).

## Usage

prepare environment:

```shell
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

run:

```shell
python3 main.py
```

You can replace the linkage name in `main.py` by the linkages in `linkages/cases.py`, or build your own linkage system
based on LinkageBuilder.

Have fun!
